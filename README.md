# ML-Spam-Filtering-Model
A Python-based implementation of a spam filter that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text messages as either spam or ham. The project contains code that preprocesses the dataset by cleaning, tokenizing, and stemming the text messages, as well as training and testing the Naive Bayes model on the dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test data. Overall, the project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem of spam filtering.
