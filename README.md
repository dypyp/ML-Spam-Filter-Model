# ML-Spam-Filtering-Model
This Python project creates a spam filter that classifies text messages as either ham or spam by applying the Naive Bayes method. Preprocessing the dataset by cleaning, tokenizing, and stemming the text messages is part of the implementation. After that, the dataset is used to train and test the Naive Bayes model, which yielded an 89% accuracy on the test set.
